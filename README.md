# Dotfiles

Current Dotfiles for my *nix installations.

Setup:

- Fedora with Gnome Shell
    - Standard themes, ricing is effort especially with Gnome.
- Tilix as a terminal emulator.
    - Solarized Light theme.
    - Fira Code nerd font.
- ZSH as my default shell
    - oh-my-zsh for some powertools
